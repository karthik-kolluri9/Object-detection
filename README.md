# Moving object detection using opencv.

Moving Object Detection using OpenCV is a computer vision project that identifies and tracks moving objects in a video stream using OpenCV. The project leverages background subtraction techniques and contour detection to efficiently detect motion. It can be used for applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and activity recognition. The implementation is lightweight and can be easily extended for real-time use cases
